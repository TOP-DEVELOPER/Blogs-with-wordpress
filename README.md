[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6bae8279-10f9-456b-82cd-0b6d56a84042/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/distracted-snyder-7d1f01/deploys)

This website is a static [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) website, created using data served from a Wordpress instance running on [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/). It is built and deployed on Netlify, and leverages the [NetlifyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/deploy-netlifypress/) Wordpress plugin to trigger new deploys when content is created or updated.

## Running Wordpress locally

To run Wordpress on your local machine, we use [Local](https://localwp.com/), an application that lets you start and stop local Wordpress instances, and push/pull data between your machine and our hosting provider.

[Follow this guide](https://wpengine.com/support/local/) to install Local on your machine, connect to our WP Engine account, and pull the `apollographql` site.

Once you have a local copy of our Wordpress instance up and running, you're ready to start the Gatsby local development environment...

## Local development

This project requires the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) to run locally. We use Netlify to store the site's environment variables and run its serverless functions locally. If you don't already have it installed, install the Netlify CLI globally.

Run `netlify init` and select the default answers to each of the following prompts to connect your local site to our project on Netlify.

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify init
```

Next, install the project's dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, start your development environment.

```bash
netlify dev
```

Now, you should have a development server running at http://localhost:8888! ðŸš€
